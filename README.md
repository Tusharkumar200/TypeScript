# TypeScript Learning Repository

Welcome to the TypeScript Learning Repository! This repository is dedicated to learning and experimenting with TypeScript.

## Overview

TypeScript is a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript. It offers static type-checking along with the latest ECMAScript features. TypeScript helps developers write safer and more robust code by catching errors early in the development process.

### Key Features of TypeScript:
- **Static Typing**: Define types for variables, function parameters, and return values.
- **Enhanced IDE Support**: Improved code completion, navigation, and refactoring.
- **ES6+ Features**: Support for modern JavaScript features like async/await, modules, and classes.
- **Compatibility**: Works seamlessly with existing JavaScript code and libraries.

## Tips for Using TypeScript

1. **Start with Basic Types**: Begin by adding types to your function parameters and return values to get immediate benefits from TypeScript.
   ```typescript
   function greet(name: string): string {
       return `Hello, ${name}!`;
   }
   ```
